## üëÄ Introduction

Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) based on cryptographic protocols has emerged as a promising paradigm to protect user data privacy in cloud-based machine learning services. While it achieves formal privacy protection, PPML often incurs significant efficiency and scalability costs due to orders of magnitude overhead compared to the plaintext counterpart. Therefore, there has been a considerable focus on mitigating the efficiency gap for PPML. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of recent PPML studies with a focus on cross-level optimizations. Specifically, we categorize existing papers into protocol level, model level, and system level, and review progress at each level. We also provide qualitative and quantitative comparisons of existing works with technical insights, based on which we discuss future research directions and highlight the necessity of **integrating optimizations across protocol, model, and system levels.**
